 * Class for encapsulating an orbBasic program, and handling the lifecycle the program is loaded, excuted, aborted, and erased. This class will handle loading a file which can be no more than 1024 bytes and the program has to download in 253 byte, so client code does not have to append each chunk. After the program is loaded, the erase method needs be called before loading another program.
