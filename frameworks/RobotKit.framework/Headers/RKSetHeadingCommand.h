 * @brief Class to encapsulate a set heading command and it's parameters.
 * 
 * Class that encapsulates a calibrate command used to set the 0째 heading. 
 * Thus, if you send a Set Heading command with parameter 0, then whichever way Sphero
 * is facing is now 0 degrees.
 *
 * Also, calling this command with Stabilizatoin off, also adjusts Sphero's idea of roll,
 * pitch, and yaw.  The orientation will now be 0,0,0 when the this command is called.
