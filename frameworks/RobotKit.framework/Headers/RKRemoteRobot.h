/*!
 *  @brief RKRemoteRobot represents a remote player's robot and allows for remote control
 *
 *  Commands can be sent by creating instances of the RKDeviceCommand subclass you want to
 *  send and calling the sendCommand method on the remote player's RKRemoteRobot instance.
 *  Currently only commands with meaningless responses are supported (e.g. no data streaming
 *  or ping commands).  There will be no response for the commands.  They are gurunteed to be
 *  delivered to the remote device but there is no guaruntee the robot will recieve them.
 *  A general rule to ensure the robot recieves the commands is to only send one command
 *  every 0.2 seconds.
 *
