 * @brief Class to encapsulate a calibrate command and it's parameters.
 * 
 * Class that encapsulates a calibrate command used to set the 0° heading. Client code can 
 * use this along with RKBackLEDOutputCommand and RKRollCommand to aim Sphero so sending a roll
 * command with 0° moves it in a user desired direction.

 * @sa RKCalibrateResponse
 * @sa RKBackLEDOutputCommand
 * @sa RKRollCommand
