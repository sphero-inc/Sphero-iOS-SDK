/*!
 *  @brief Main class used to integrate your application with SpheroWorld and allow users to login
 *
 *  Use this class to authenticate your application with SpheroWorld.  Use the setAppID:secret:
 *  class method before you make any other RobotKit calls in the applicationDidFinishLaunching
 *  method of your app delegate. This will ensure that stats such as drive times, drive distances,
 *  color changes and boosts that happen in your application will be associated with the user's
 *  SpheroWorld profile.
 *
 *  The second purpose of this class is to allow the user to login to SpheroWorld and display
 *  the achievements associated with your application along with their progress toward earning
 *  the achievements.  Simply present this view controller as a modalViewController in your
 *  app and set the presenter as the delegate.  If has never logged in with your application
 *  they will be presented with a login screen, otherwise the user will be shown a list of
 *  the achievements for your application along with their progress.
 *
 *  Achievements need to be setup on SpheroWorld and progress tracked through the RKAchievement
 *  class.
 *  @see RKAchievement
