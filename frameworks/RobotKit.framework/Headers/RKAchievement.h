/*!
 *  @brief Class that represents a SpheroWorld achievements and handles achievement tracking
 *
 *  Achievements will need to be created and setup on the SpheroWorld website. In order to use
 *  achievements in your application you will need to properly set your appID and secret using
 *  the RKSpheroWorldAuth class when your application starts.  This will also ensure that
 *  driving stats such as distances, drive times, color changes and boosts will be tracked on
 *  the users SpheroWorld profile.
 *  @see RKSpheroWorldAuth
 *
 *  Achievement meta data and progress will automatically be loaded from SpheroWorld if the user
 *  is logged in.  Use the RKSpheroWorldAuth class to present a user with a login screen.
 *  @see RKSpheroWorldAuth
 *
 *  Register for the RKAchievementEarned notification to know when an achievement has been earned.
 *
 *  Call the recordEvent class method to update achievement progress as events in your game happen.
 * 
 *  If you would like to track drive times, distances or color changes to give users achievements
 *  you may register for the RKDriveTimeNotification, RKDriveDistanceNotification or 
 *  RKDriveColorNotification.  The recordEvent class method can then be called from your code
 *  to give users progress towards achievements in a method appropriate to your game.
